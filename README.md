## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Architecture Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access abstraction layer
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Clear separation of UI and business logic
- **Modular Design**: Scalable architecture for future feature expansion

### Core Technologies

#### Development Framework
- **Platform**: Native Android development
- **Language**: Kotlin for modern, expressive programming
- **UI Framework**: Traditional Android View system

#### Navigation & User Flow

- **Bottom Navigation**: Intuitive app section navigation
- **Navigation Components**: NavController and NavGraph for structured navigation flow

#### Data & Persistence
- **Local Database**: Room SQLite abstraction for robust offline storage
- **Reactive Programming**: Flow and LiveData for responsive data handling
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Kotlin Coroutines for efficient background processing

#### Advanced UI Components
- **Dynamic Forms**: Multi-Type ViewHolders with Nested RecyclerView architecture
- **Custom Adapters**: For example, one of the adapters, `BridgeCheckFormFieldsAdapter` supporting various question formats:
  - Header sections
  - Text input fields
  - Boolean questions with/without image attachments
  - Multi-field text responses
- **Real-Time Video**: MjpegView for live drone camera feed display

#### Location & Mapping
- **Google Maps Integration**: SupportMapFragment for interactive map experience
- **Location Services**: LocationServices and FusedLocationProviderClient for GPS
- **Address Resolution**: Geocoder for coordinate-to-address conversion
- **Precise Positioning**: Accurate bridge location identification and storage

## üì± Usage Workflow

### Bridge Registration
1. **Add New Bridge**: Fill out bridge information form
2. **Location Selection**: Use interactive map to pinpoint exact location
3. **Data Validation**: Automatic address retrieval and coordinate confirmation

### Inspection Process
1. **Select Bridge**: Choose from registered bridges list
2. **Fill Inspection Form**: Complete dynamic questionnaire
3. **Document Issues**: Attach photos from gallery, camera, or drone
4. **Submit Report**: Generate comprehensive inspection report

### Drone Operations
1. **Connect Drone**: Enter drone camera IP address
2. **Live Feed**: View real-time MJPEG video stream
3. **Capture Documentation**: Save key footage for inspection reports

## üî¨ Research & Development

### Innovation Aspects
